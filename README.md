This repository contains my accomplishments following a [course on Mycropython](https://github.com/pythoncanarias/upython) at Python Canarias, by [Zerasul](https://github.com/zerasul). 

## Exercise 1: Blink
This simple exercise consists on making a LED blink, using our Node MCU platform, a LED and a resistance.
The code is in the "ex1-blink" folder and the result can be seen in the following video:

## Exercise 2: Push-button
In this case, we are introducing a push-button to make the LED blink on demand. 
The code is in the "ex2-push-button" folder and the result can be seen in the following video:
